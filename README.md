# Expense Tracker API

A comprehensive RESTful API for managing personal expenses with JWT authentication, built with NestJS, Prisma, and SQLite.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **User Management**: Secure registration and login with JWT authentication
- **Expense Tracking**: Full CRUD operations for expenses
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter expenses by date range and category
- **Monthly Summaries**: Get spending totals by category and month
- **Recent Expenses**: Quick access to last 5 expenses

### Technical Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Swagger Documentation**: Interactive API documentation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using class-validator
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across all endpoints
- **Database Transactions**: All mutations wrapped in Prisma transactions
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with Docker

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- SQLite (included with the project)

## Authentication

The API uses JWT tokens for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

### Sample Login Credentials (after seeding)
```
Email: john@example.com
Password: password123

Email: jane@example.com
Password: password123
```

## Example Requests

### Register a new user
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "name": "John Doe"
  }'
```

### Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

### Create an expense
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/expenses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 25.50,
    "date": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z",
    "category": "Food",
    "note": "Lunch at restaurant"
  }'
```

### Get monthly summary
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/expenses/summary/monthly?year=2025&month=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>"
```

```

The test suite includes:
- Authentication service tests
- Expense service tests
- Input validation tests
- Error handling tests

## Database Schema

### User
- `id` - Primary key
- `email` - Unique email address
- `password` - Hashed password
- `name` - Optional user name
- `createdAt` - Creation timestamp
- `updatedAt` - Last update timestamp

### Expense
- `id` - Primary key

## Project Structure

- `prisma/` - Prisma schema and migrations


## Design Decisions
- **Database:** SQLite is used for simplicity and local development. It requires no external server and is ideal for prototyping and small-scale apps. Prisma ORM manages migrations and queries, with the schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma` and the database file stored as `dev.db` in the project root.
- **Prisma ORM:** Prisma provides type-safe database access and easy migrations. The Prisma client is generated in `generated/prisma`.
- **NestJS Routing & Structure:**
  - The `src/` folder contains all application code.
  - Each resource (e.g., `user`) has its own folder (`src/user/`) containing its controller, service, DTOs, and tests.
  - The main entry point is `src/main.ts`, which bootstraps the app and sets up Swagger.
  - Routes are defined in controllers (e.g., `user.controller.ts`), grouped by resource/module for clarity and scalability.
  - The root module (`app.module.ts`) imports feature modules (e.g., `user.module.ts`).

- **Error Handling:** All API endpoints include comprehensive error handling for empty inputs, null/undefined values, and boundary conditions (such as 0, negative numbers, and max integer values). Errors are caught and returned with meaningful messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.
- **Validation:** DTOs use class-validator decorators to enforce input constraints (e.g., required fields, string length, valid email format, integer boundaries). Invalid requests are rejected with clear validation error responses.
- **Error Responses:** The API returns structured error responses for validation failures, not found errors, and server errors, following REST best practices for status codes and message clarity.
- **DB Transactions:** All create, update, and delete operations are executed within Prisma transactions to ensure data consistency and atomicity. This design prevents partial updates and supports future extensibility for multi-step operations.
